Smart Team Chat UI
(Aligned with WorkElate: OS & Collaboration)

This project is a minimal React prototype of a Smart Team Chat UI. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can enhance team communication by providing intelligent suggestions, summaries, and prompts directly within the chat interface. The focus is on the UI/UX and AI-first placeholders, not on a functional backend or real-time chat integration.

‚ú® Features
The application is a lightweight prototype featuring three core screens:

1. Chat List
Displays a list of dummy chat conversations populated from local JSON data.

Each item shows the contact's name, the last message, and the timestamp.

2. Chat Window
Shows a conversation thread with dummy messages.

Includes AI-powered feature placeholders:

Summarize Thread: A button to generate a concise summary of the conversation (displays a dummy summary).

Smart Reply Suggestion: A button to generate a context-aware reply suggestion.

3. New Chat
A simple screen to initiate a new conversation by entering a participant's name.

Includes an AI-powered icebreaker feature:

Generate Icebreaker: A button that creates a sample friendly message to start the conversation.
